# React Crime Map

This is a simple React application that places markers on a map for crimes that have happened in a certain area. To keep things simple I've chosen `lat: 52.629729` and `lng: -1.131592` to be the location of search.

### The stack
- React
- Redux
- Jest
- Webpack
- Gulp

### Local installation
```
git clone git@github.com:muhanad40/React-crime-map.git
cd React-crime-map
npm install
npm run start
```

Your default browser should open and show the application. You can change the date in the top input box and see the map update the clusters/markers.

This app could obviously be improved with so many additional features, but due to the large amount of possibilities, it's wise to keep things simple to demonstrate the power of React ;)
